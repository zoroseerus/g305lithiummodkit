# g305lithiummodkit
a modkit for the Logitech G305 so you can use lithium batteries and save some weight

Hi there,

Some time ago, enncoo sort of dropped off and nobody is sure what happened to them. As such there's been a hole that their modkit served, so I paid somebody to reverse engineer it on fiverr (@duca99, https://www.fiverr.com/duca99?source=gig_page) so this could be remedied. It seems right to release the files since it's not my design. Hopefully this helps someone.

If you're just interested in buying the modkits, I'll be selling those on https://www.etsy.com/listing/1679779226/logitech-g305-modkit-for-weight , but you can also take these files to a site to make them *queue PCBWAY sponsor segment of the video... wait this isn't YouTube. I digress*. 

I'm uploading the files on here as I was given them, as I'm pretty unfamiliar with PCB design and github such. If there's a signiciantly better way to group them or such feel free to let me know and I can re-arrange things as needed.

I'm under the impression that any (correctly pinned) 3.7V lithium ion batteries should work with it. my example photos are with a 150mAh one as it's a decent size while not being particularly massive, but you can go smaller or larger as desired I believe.

simplified diagram of how it's hooked up:
